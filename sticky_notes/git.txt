FInd the branch point between rev_a and rev_b

git rev-list --tags rev_a ^rev_b

suppose rev_a composes of set of commits
c1,c2,....cb,cn,cn+1,cn+2......
and rev_b which was branched out at point b has the set of commits
c1,c2,....cb, cm,cm+1,cm+2 ... etc

THen the above command deletes the prefix c1,c2,...cb and returns cn, cn+1, cn+2 ...

The commit id of the branch point cb is now just cn^1
